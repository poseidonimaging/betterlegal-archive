                    <h3 align="left">Acceptance of the Terms of Use</h3>
                    <p align="left">These terms of use are entered into by and between You and BetterLegal Solutions LLC ("Company", "we" or "us"). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these "Terms of Use"), govern your access to and use of www.betterlegal.com (“Website”), including any content, functionality and services offered on or through such websites, whether as a guest or a registered user. Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Website. By using the Website, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our privacy policy found at http://www.betterlegal.com/privacy (the “Privacy Policy”), which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to or accept these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website.</p>
                    <p align="left">The Website is only offered and available to users who are 18 or older and fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Use, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Use. If you do not meet all of the foregoing requirements, you must not access or use any Website.</p>
                    
                    <h3 align="left">Changes to the Terms of Use</h3>
                    <p align="left">We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in the Governing Law and Jurisdiction section below will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice on or prior to the date the change is posted on the Website. Your continued use of the Website following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes. We encourage and expect you to consult the Terms of Use each time you access a Website so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>

                    <h3 align="left">We Are Not Your Attorney – Always Seek Professional Legal Advice if Possible</h3>
                    <p align="left">The Website’s goal is to provide an easy, online method of forming a new business for individuals who either cannot or choose not to engage an attorney for this purpose. While we attempt to provide some basic information about the formation of business entities and other general legal topics, and while we review the information you provide us for typos, consistency, completeness, spelling, and similar clerical matters, we do not and cannot review your answers for legal sufficiency, apply the law to your particular situation, draw legal conclusions, provide legal advice, explanations, options, opinions, or recommendations about legal rights, remedies, business structure and operations, use of business and legal forms, or general business and legal strategies. BetterLegal is not a law firm, nor is it a substitution for a law firm or an attorney. BetterLegal strives to facilitate the process by which individuals set up their businesses, but we do not and cannot perform the services provided by licensed attorneys.</p>

                    <p align="left">BetterLegal endeavors to provide comprehensive forms that can be used successfully by most new businesses. We attempt to keep our documents current and to adapt our documents in the event of any critical changes in applicable law, but the law and standard industry practices can change rapidly, and we make no guarantee that our documents completely current. Moreover, BetterLegal’s form documents make assumptions about Your new business that may not be correct. While we believe that our forms are appropriate for most new businesses, they may not be ideal for your company’s particular situation, especially if you are attempting to establish a complex business structure. <b>You should always review our forms before signing them and consult with an attorney should you have any questions or concerns.</b></p>

                    <p align="left">Your use of the Website does not create an attorney-client relationship with BetterLegal Solutions, LLC, its members, managers, officers, employees, or other agents (even if such persons are licensed attorneys).</p>
